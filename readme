The code is an example of an Fibonacci sequence
The Fibonacci series is a series where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1.

This program will request a maximum nth value to reach in generating the Fibonacci sequence. It will display all terms generated less than or equal to the nth term.

This version is iterative.

Formula:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

with seed values of F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
